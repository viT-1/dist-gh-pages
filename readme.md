Simplest project for hosting static gh-pages (SPA further).
Use `npm run deploy` for deploying dist folder to remote (no need to commit) repository on GitHub,
then you can see [demo site](https://vit-1.github.io/dist-gh-pages/).

ESM aliases resolved by hands with [replace-in-file](https://github.com/adamreisnz/replace-in-file) node [script](https://github.com/viT-1/dist-gh-pages/blob/dce502b314fb81b4bf086af6b64fe983ff6cdde9/package.json#L21).
